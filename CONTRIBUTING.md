### Pull Requests

The fastest way to get a changes made is to contribute a pull request,
when doing so, please open a feature request or file a bug report  in the
issues first where we can discuss the problem and possible soultions.

Feel free to open a draft pull request early in the process and we can
help with any of the following steps.

A single pull requests should contain either a single feature, or wide
spread corrections too formatting/whitespace/etc, not both.

Code contributions need to be accompanied by tests and documentation for 
the added code.

Make sure that you run the code formatter and that our linting checks
and tests all pass.

We would appreciate it if you formatted your commit messages according 
to the [conventional commits][conventionalcommits] standard, but we can
also fix things up when merging the pull request, so dont worry too 
much if it doesnt make sense to you.
